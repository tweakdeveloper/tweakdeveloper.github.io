            I am a developer experienced in technologies for both native mobile 
            and web development as well as some backend development. 
            Specifically, I am knowledgeable in the use of the Android SDK, 
            including tools such as the Android Support Libraries and Android 
            Studio; the iOS SDK, including the use of tools such as Xcode and 
            Interface Builder; and web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and 
            JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I am familiar with constructing backend solutions 
            that will fit any of these platforms. In the past I have usually 
            preferred Go to write a server, however I am always looking to 
            expand my knowledge of backend development with new languages and 
            technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently based in the Kansas City area and am looking to work 
            remotely. I have experience with the most commonly used version 
            control system, Git, that allows me to work from anywhere and share 
            the final products with you, wherever you may be based.

            My primary experience consists of work in Android development. I 
            have extensive knowledge of working in Java to develop Android 
            apps, and am learning Kotlin as Android tooling continues to 
            evolve. I am familiar with the use of the Support Libraries to 
            support a wide range of devices and Android versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also recently become involved in iOS development. I am 
            becoming familiar with the use of Swift for iOS development, and am 
            already comfortable with the use of Interface Builder and 
            Storyboards to construct compelling layouts. I also have experience 
            integrating dependencies with both CocoaPods and Carthage, so I'll 
            be able to add on to your existing app or set up a brand new app 
            regardless of any external libraries you may already be using.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout years of development, I've created many web pages, 
            including single page applications. I'm comfortable working with 
            many different front end libraries, including Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I have developed backends to support all of these 
            applications, no matter the platform. I have experience developing 
            in Go, which has vast support for libraries that enable me to 
            use whatever software you're comfortable with, such as 
            MySQL/MariaDB, Firebase, AWS, and more.
